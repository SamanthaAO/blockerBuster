View deployed project here => https://blockerbuster.herokuapp.com/

Have you ever been coding away and then run face first into the mother of all blockers. You throw everything you have at it, but there is nothing that you can do to fix the issue you are facing. It is time to take a step back, regroup and let your mind take a break. Often through this process of takign a step back and lettign your mind wander the answer to your blocker will become apparent. However, this takign a break and disengaging can be a struggle. ENTERBLOCKER BUSTER the fun filled game where you can let your mind wander and even chat to developers so that your blockers can become a thing of the past. 



To begin blocker buster you are going to want to sign up, or log in if you have already created an account. Once you are on the main page you can read the descriptions of the games and click on buttons to select the game that you would liek to play or view the high scores for that game. 

The front-end game:
This game consists of you using the W, A, and D keys to navigate and the clicker to fire bullets into the direction of the pointer. Your goal is to break the cages to collect your front end skills. Once all 5 skills have been collected then a bug will be spawned and the skills will be redeployed. You must keeep breaking cages and collecting skills for as long as possible withput colliding with a bug. Spoiler alert you cannot shoot the bugs to kill them, so they will accumulate and become more dangerous as you collect mroe points. Colliding with a bug will trigger a game over and then your total score will be added to the high scores list. 

The back-end game: W, A, and D keys are still used to navigate, but you do not have a shooter on this one. Your bobjective is to collect as many points as possible by collecting backend skills without beign hit by one of the rotating spinning wheels of death. 

chat: Each game has a chat button under the game. This will open a chat window into the game specific chatroom. This allows you to be able to ask other developers questions about the blocker that is stumpign you.
